Also, there is a difference with the magnitude of variation, where the one-R error rate for a particular feature converging to a maximum of the prior obese probability because it takes the majority class label for each feature value, causing the gender, SCC and MTRANS to have the same error rate. On the other hand, the MI scores have different values for these 3 features with gender having a much lower score of 5.82e-5 as compared to SCC with 2.23e-3, indicating that gender is less correlated to obesity compared to SCC according to MI."

    "(a) The Gaussian Naive Bayes on the just the numerical features leads to the best performance with an error rate of 0.13 and macro F1 score of 0.87. Comparing with the Gaussian Naive Bayes on the one hot encoded categorical features + numerical features, the error rate from this method is higher at 0.21, which could be due to applying a gaussian distribution to binary feature labels, where a bernoulli distribution should be chosen instead. Furthermore, comparing with the categorical naive bayes sets, the error rate from this method is higher at 0.19 and 0.21 for the discretised full and only categorical features respectively, which could be due to information loss of numerical features from discretised binning and using categorical distribution on binary features, where a bernoulli distribution should be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Standardisation on the numerical data before performing Gaussian Naive Bayes will not lead to a change in the results because standardising the numerical features to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 will scale the numerical values to a normal distribution. This procedure of fitting the numerical features into a normal distribution is a step performed in the Gaussian Naive Bayes, therefore, applying this standardisation before performing Gaussian Naive Bayes will not change the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The drawback with fixing the number of equal-width bins for all numerical features is that the range of the numerical features vary greatly. This means that numerical features with a large range such as weight will lose information due to a large bin width, and features with a small range such as TUE could create excessive bins with a small bin width which does not give a sense of distribution. The binning strategy I would use is an equal bin width but using the Freedman–Diaconis rule to create a different number of bins depending on the numerical feature, to better characterise the distribution $\\text{Bin Width} = 2\\frac{IQR}{\\sqrt[3]n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Since it is important to avoid falsely diagnosing a patient as obese, false positives have to be low compared to the number of false negatives. Therefore, precision would be a the important measure to reduce the number of false positives instead of error rate, which could be misleadingly high with a high true negative rate but precision will not reveal problems with an algorithm that predicts every patient as notObese. Accounting for this, a F0.5 scores is used to balance recall and precision, where precision is emphasised over recall to ensure a low false postive rate while to a lesser extent, accounting for false negatives to avoid diagnosing obese patients as not obese.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) There is a clear difference in error rate when comparing the discriminative logistic regression and the generative naive bayes classifiers, with logistic regression having a much lower error of 0.06 compared to the best naive bayes classifier error of 0.13. LR outperforms NB because the dataset is large enough (1688 training instances) and LR maximises the posterior probability directly by minimising the negative conditional log likelihood, however, NB assumes conditional independance between the features to arrive at the posterior probability even though there are some features that are highly dependent such as height and weight. NB will outperform LR if the dataset is small and there are limited training instances because of the independence assumption which allows the model to converge quicker, as compared to LR which needs a large amount of data converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) An infinitely large database will not lead to perfect test set performance because (assuming the features are linearly seperable), using iterative gradient descent on the derivative of the log likelihood for each parameter will converge to a global minimum with log-likelihood being globally concave. However, this does not mean that the LR coefficients are perfect for every test set as it is fit to a training set, and far outliers in the test set or test instances where feature values are identical to instances in the training set with a different classification can occur in real-life datasets.\n"
